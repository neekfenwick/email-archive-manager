***** DEVELOPERS START *****

Note: Always backup your shop files and database before making changes.


Installation:

1. Download the package and unzip to a temp directory.

2. Copy the contents of entire "admin" folder to the (renamed) admin folder of your shop, using the existing folder structure as a guide for where to put the new files. The files are already arranged in the appropriate structure, and there are *no* overwrites!

3. You'll find "E-mail Archive Manager" under "Tools" in the Admin. You may need to assign it to additional user profiles, depending on who you wish to allow permission to use it.

4. By default, email archiving is turned OFF; to start archiving emails, you must turn it ON under
   Admin > Configuration > Email Options > Email Archiving Active?
